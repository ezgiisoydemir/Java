                        Array VS ArrayList

     - Array is a fixed-length data structure, so we can't change length of Array
       once we initialize. Arraylist is resizable (Dynamic Array)

     - Array can contain both primitive and reference types
       ArrayList can only store reference types

     - Also we can compare Array and ArrayList on how to calculate size
       We use length() method for Arrays, size() method for ArrayList
